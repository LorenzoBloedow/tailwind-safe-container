A Tailwind plugin.

## Usage
First inject the plugin and then just add -safe or -unsafe to any of the alignment properties that are also set to center.

## Example

`justify-center-unsafe`

## Compatibility
[Currently only Firefox supports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content#browser_compatibility) the `safe` and `unsafe` keyword.
